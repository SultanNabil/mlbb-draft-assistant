# MLBB Draft Assistant

**MLBB Draft Assistant** is a web application that helps _Mobile Legends: Bang Bang_ players make smarter draft decisions.  
It analyzes hero relationships (counters, countered by, synergy, anti-synergy) and calculates a score to identify the best and worst picks for your situation.

## How It Works

Each hero is connected to others through four relationship types:

| Relationship | Effect                      | Score |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ----- |
| Counters     | Strong against another hero | +1    |
| Countered by | Weak against another hero   | −1    |
| Synergy      | Works well with allies      | +0.1  |
| Anti-synergy | Conflicts with allies       | −0.1  |

The algorithm sums these values to determine a hero’s overall suitability within the draft.

## Data Source and Disclaimer

All data is based on publicly available information from the  
[official Mobile Legends website](https://www.mobilelegends.com/).

The dataset only includes the top 5–10 visible relationships per hero, so the results are approximate and should be used as a general guideline rather than an absolute reference.

**Last data update:** June 2026
